# 👋 Hi, I'm @Galgathor

I'm a Unity C# developer, backend developer, and Linux-focused system administrator with a passion for building mechanics, systems, and intelligent tools. Although I currently work as an HVAC technician, I’m transitioning into the IT field where my long-term interests truly are. I’ve been learning programming and systems administration since I was 15, starting with JavaScript—but I quickly discovered that what I *really* enjoy is creating the systems that make ideas come alive.

## 🌐 Projects

### **AI Dungeon Master**
My largest and proudest project, hosted on **galgathor.com**.  
It’s a D&D-inspired system that uses ChatGPT as a dynamic dungeon master while storing persistent game state, items, characters, and combat logic in a database.  
It supports multiple PCs, NPCs, and automated combat resolution.
